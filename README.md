# Backup

This repository contains a system that I made and use to backup and maintain
my Alpine Linux setup.

It has a bunch of recipes to automate parts of my backup process.

If you would like to clone my setup, you only need to type this command on the
tty:

**THIS ONLY WORKS WITH ALPINE LINUX**

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tukainpng/backup; cd backup; make setup
```

### Things to know

- If you want to use this to backup your files, know that you are expected to
modify the `Makefile`.
- I'm not responsable of any loss of data, however important it is.
